*** [1/5] TODO Location
Overall owner: Sandy(?)
*** DONE City
CLOSED: [2017-09-18 Mon 15:26]
Choice: Bengaluru
- Bengaluru
  - Logically makes sense. Majority of the organizers are based in Bengaluru and most sponsors, and on-the-ground support, too will likely be in Bengaluru
- Pune
  - Too much of Bengaluru for every tech conf
  - Need tech communities to be encouraged/nurtured/grown at other places
  - Bengaluru gets it share of tech stuff, including Clojure (monthly meets)

*** TODO Venue type
- Hotel?
- MLR (speak with Zainab)
- Nimhans Convention Center (via Sandy)

*** TODO Food Arrangements
- Food arrangements are important, and if not part of the deal with the venue, good food should be accessible close-by.

*** TODO AV arrangements
  - MLR provides (From capturing to processing/uploading)
  - AV needs to be fine-tuned beforehand. (Different speakers, devices, preferences)
  - AV cost increases based on stage/backdrop/screen/cameras/people-who-handle
  - Owner: Srihari

*** TODO [0/4] Other points
**** TODO Number of participants
**** TODO Contract
**** TODO Urgency - because of the wedding season coming.
**** TODO Sponsorship + ticket prices => location


*** TODO Trust
- Satish?
 - Mohit reached out to him. Dinkar also pointed towards him
- Mohit on it right now, but nothing is clear yet given the time-lines


*** TODO Sponsorship
- Go-Jek (Srihari)
- Nilenso (Srihari)
** sandy's notes
- date: 2nd & 3rd dec?
- location: blr (3 people in blr, running around will be involved)
- fix a venue now: wedding season

- hotels might have conference packages
- conventions might be cheaper though -- MLR, NIMHANS

- get day in your head chalked out before talking to hotels
- price is typically open to negotiation

- ticket prices needn't be directly correlated to hotel costs etc
- sponsorships could subsidise ticket costs

- last year's hotel prices: 1k per head, minimum guarantee of 100 people
- prices will be different in blr though

- AV: you pay for the stage, screen, backdrop, cameras

- mohit: will link my spreadsheet from last year

- sandy: will call up hotels and get prices

- five talks should be enough for one day

- srihari: one day of workshops
- keep workshop open to everyone

- clojurebridge has a curriculum in place, which will be helpful
- clojurebridge has to be free? would that work?

- we could alternatively just use their curriculum; can't conduct this under the clojurebridge banner

- shantanu: concur office is big enough for a workshop, but depends on date
- won't work on a weekday

- had 90 last year
- would budget for 100 - 150 people

- AV is important; want someone who understands tech conferences
- expect around 50 at workshop
- 1:10 workshop coaches

- if garden city trust doesn't work, might try ETT by ajey, niranjan, sidu etc
- mohit: will oversee trust things

- mohit will add us to the website github repo
- srihari will own look and feel of the website

- sponsorship
- mohit: this will depend on our costs
- will have to send out emails to potential sponsors
- got initial responses from go-jek and nilenso already

- AV: srihari and sandy

- should keep food arrangements in mind along with venue
